                        <p>Pinnacle 21 is committed to protecting your privacy. Here you can find the privacy principles that guide everything we do and what we stand for as a company. If you want to know exactly what we are doing to protect the privacy of your information and to keep your information secure, you can read our <a class="tab-link" href="#Website">Website Privacy Policy</a> and <a class="tab-link" href="#Community">Community Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Transparency</h3>
                        <p>We want our customers and users to know everything they need to know before trusting us with their sensitive data. To show you how important privacy is to Pinnacle 21, we developed <a class="tab-link" href="#Basics">Privacy Basics</a> to help you easily understand what information we collect when you use our products, how we use it, with whom we may share it, and your choices. In case you want to know more, we also have a Privacy Policy that’s not written in legalese, so you won’t have to call your lawyer every time you want to use our products or services.</p>
                        <h3>Privacy</h3>
                        <p>Because we believe that truly protecting your privacy means not turning you into the product, we do not sell the information we collect about you to third parties. We will only disclose your information to third parties in the circumstances detailed in our <a class="tab-link" href="#website">Website Privacy Policy</a> and <a class="tab-link" href="#Community">Community Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Security</h3>
                        <p>We continually improve our security systems and invest time and resources in making sure that your data and information are kept secure. We only contract with third parties if they can demonstrate that they hold the same (or higher) security standards as we do. Because we don’t want any loose ends, we also train our employees to be privacy-savvy and to know how to safeguard your information and data.</p>
                        <h3>Improvement</h3>
                        <p>Why do we want to collect your information, anyway? At Pinnacle 21, we believe that there’s always room for improvement. That’s why we care about collecting your information: we want to know how our clients interact with our products so we can figure out which features they love and which ones need to be perfected, what capabilities they’d like our products to have, which features they don’t really use, etc.</p>
                        <h3>Choice</h3>
                        <p>We will always allow you to choose how much Personal Information you want to share with us, and you will even have the option to direct us to delete any Personal Information we have ever collected about you from our records. However, keep in mind that some of our products’ functionalities might be limited, or not work, if you decide not to share some of your Personal Information.</p>

                        <h2>Privacy Basics</h2>
                        <p>If you’ve ever tried to read <em>(or wish that you could understand)</em> a privacy policy before, you know how long and technical they tend to be. We’ve all been there, but we still don’t know anyone who has ever enjoyed it. Since you have made it this far, you probably <em>(really)</em> care about your privacy, so we want to make things as easy as possible for you because Pinnacle 21 was literally created to facilitate processes. These Privacy Basics are intended to give you a summary of what you absolutely need to know about our privacy practices before using Pinnacle 21 Community or our website, but if you’re feeling adventurous and would like to read our full, detailed Privacy Policy, you can <a href="#">click here</a>. Please note that, if your business/employer has executed an agreement permitting use of the Pinnacle 21 Enterprise software-as-a-service platform, then that agreement will govern our collection and use of information while you are using Pinnacle 21 Enterprise or any of its related services. If you or your business/employer is located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, <a href="#">click here</a> for more information.</p>

Personal Information can be used to identify you, so it’s very important to us that you know what pieces of Personal Information we can collect from our customers and users. Please read the <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> applicable to the product you’ll be using to learn exactly what Personal Information and Non-Personal Information we will collect.</p>

                        <p>If you’re wondering why we bother to collect all this information in the first place, here are some examples of what we may do with it:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Make our website and our products work;</li>
                            <li>Monitor our website’s and our products’ performance;</li>
                            <li>Develop, support, and improve our website and our products;</li>
                            <li>Keep our website and our products secure;</li>
                            <li>Create de-identified user metrics and analytics <em>(which we use internally for website and product development and improvement);</em></li>
                            <li>Communicate with our users and customers.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>How we share it</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes sharing is not caring, and we care. We care about your privacy and the privacy of your company. For that reason, <strong>we will not sell or disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</strong> The only times that we might need to disclose your Personal Information to third parties are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When we need to do so in order to provide our services or allow a third party to perform functions on our behalf; </li>
                            <li>To comply with laws and regulations, to cooperate with law enforcement, or to prevent harm to others or ourselves; or</li>
                            <li>In the unlikely event that our company is sold to a third party or files for bankruptcy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Your Non-Personal Information, on the other hand, may be disclosed to our clients, business partners, independent contractors, investors, potential buyers, or other third parties, but only after it has been de-identified and grouped with information about other consumers so that it is anonymous. This means that this information cannot, under any reasonable circumstances, be used to personally identify you.</p>

                        <p>We do not disclose your Personal Information to anyone, except when we need to do so in order to provide our services or allow a third party to perform functions on our behalf, to comply with laws and regulations, to cooperate with law enforcement, to prevent harm to others or ourselves, and in the unlikely event that our company is sold to a third party or files for bankruptcy.

While Personal Information can be used to identify an individual, non-Personal Information cannot. Because we respect your privacy, we will not use any non-Personal Information that we collect to try to identify you. However, if we later combine your non-Personal Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the resulting information as Personal Information and be extra careful when we store it. Just so you know, this information may be collected either by us or by one of our service providers, but either way this Privacy Policy will govern how we handle it.</p>
                        <p>The only Personal Information we may collect (and store) when you download Community is:</p>

                        <p>Whether you have signed up for Pinnacle ID or not, your GUID will be tied to reports containing information about:</p>

                        <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from users under 18 years of age, and we do not authorize users under 18 years of age to use our software or services.
